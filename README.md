  - Autocompletion support for: Docker, Kubernetes (kubectl, helm), Homebrew, Git and All general commands
  - Improves discoverability and speeds up command-line usage

### `Prerequisites for zshrc`

Ensure you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed. If not, install it using:
```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Run the following commands to install the necessary `brew` packages:
```sh
# Linux packages - These helps bash scripts developed in Mac, will work on Linux seamlessly.
brew install coreutils gawk gnu-sed bash openssl

# Zsh plugins
brew install zsh-completions zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions zsh-history-substring-search

# Git and GitHub CLI
brew install git gh

# Docker - May not need to install, if you are using Docker Desktop
brew install docker

# Kubernetes tools
brew install kubernetes-cli aws-iam-authenticator

# AWS CLI
brew install awscli
```

**Additional Notes (zshrc):**
- For Docker and Kubernetes completions, ensure the completions are set up as described in the .zshrc.
- Install aws-profile-manager from [HERE](https://github.com/sidh4u/aws-profile-manager) for `AWS profile management`.
- VMware tools require VMware Fusion, which can be downloaded from [Broadcom](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/315638/download-and-install-vmware-fusion.html) website.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart | How to setup

1. Clone the repo (or just checkout the relevant branch):
    ```sh
    gh repo clone sidh4u/dotfiles-minimal
    cd dotfiles-minimal
    ```
2. Set up Vim and Zsh configs:
   ```sh
    cp vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
    cp zsh/zshrc ~/.zshrc
   ```
3. Launch Vim once to trigger automatic plugin installation:
   ```sh
   vi
   ```
4. Restart your terminal or source your .zshrc:
   ```sh
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Some Zsh features depend on Homebrew and a few commonly used plugins (e.g., zsh-autosuggestions, zsh-syntax-highlighting). Make sure you have those installed via brew.
